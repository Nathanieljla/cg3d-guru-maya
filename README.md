# cg3d-maya
The best of my personal maya scripts for public consumption in an easy to use module.

# Installation

### Drag & Drop
1. Download [install_cg3d_maya.py](https://github.com/Nathanieljla/cg3d-maya/releases/download/v0.5.2/install_cg3d_maya.py)
2. Drag-n-drop the downloaded file into the Maya viewport.
3. Hit "Install" and wait until it says the installation is complete.

Once the installation has finished you should see a new menu labeled "Guru" on the main menu bar. 

When closing Maya the first time after the installation, you might see a dialog like this:

You'll want to say "yes" to this dialog.
